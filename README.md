HiðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m @DominguezIsaac, a physics student at Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona.

Here you can find some projects i've been working on in different subjects such as thermodynamics or numerical methods. 

This projects ara basically simulations designed to improve my programing skills, but I think some are interesting so feel free to take a look!
