HiðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m @DominguezIsaac, a physics student at Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona.

Here you can explore some projects i've worked on during my studies, including topics like thermodynamics or numerical methods. 

This projects, primarily simulations, were designed to improve my programing skills, but I belive some may also be of interest to you. Feel free to take a look!
